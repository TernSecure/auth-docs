## Configuring Authorized Domains

To ensure that your Firebase project is only accessible from trusted domains, you must add them to the authorized domains list.

1.  In the Firebase Console, navigate to the **Authentication** section from the left-hand menu.
2.  Select the **Settings** tab.
3.  Under the **Authorized domains** section, click **Add domain**.
4.  Add all the domains from which your application will be accessed (e.g., `localhost` for development, `your-app.com` for production).

  While your Firebase API key (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`) is considered public, Firebase uses the authorized domains list to block requests from any domain not on the list. This is a critical security step to prevent unauthorized use of your Firebase project.
