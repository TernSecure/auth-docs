## Firebase Configuration

TernSecure relies on environment variables for its Firebase configuration. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the variables shown below.

### How to get your Firebase credentials

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. Once the project is created, navigate to **Project Overview** by clicking the gear icon, then select **Project settings**.

3. In the **General** tab, scroll down to the **Your apps** section and click **Add app**.

4. Select the **Web** platform (`</>`).

5. Follow the registration steps. After creating the app, you will be presented with an `firebaseConfig` object. These are your **Client SDK** credentials.

6. To get your **Admin SDK** credentials, go to the **Service accounts** tab in your Project settings. Click on **Generate new private key** to download a JSON file containing the `project_id`, `client_email`, and `private_key`.

```bash title=".env.local"
# Firebase Client SDK Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Firebase Admin SDK Configuration (for server-side operations)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-service-account-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-firebase-service-account-private-key
```

After setting up your credentials, it is critical to [configure your authorized domains](./authorized-domains).
