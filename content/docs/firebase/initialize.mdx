## Obtain your Firebase config object

Get your Firebase project's Client SDK and Admin SDK credentials from the Firebase Console (Project settings → Your apps and Service accounts). Copy the Client SDK config (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) and the Admin service account JSON, then set the values in environment variables as shown below.

<Callout>
	We recommend storing your app's Firebase project configuration in environment variables. TernSecure instances will read these env vars and handle Firebase initialization for you.
</Callout>



```bash title=".env.local"
# Firebase Client SDK Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id

# Firebase Admin SDK Configuration (for server-side operations)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-service-account-client-email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-firebase-service-account-private-key
```

After setting up your credentials, it is critical to [configure your authorized domains](./authorized-domains).
