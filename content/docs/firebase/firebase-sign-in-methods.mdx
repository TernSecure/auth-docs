## Enabling Sign-in Methods

Before users can sign in, you must enable the authentication providers you want to support in your application.

1.  In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), navigate to the **Authentication** section from the left-hand menu.
2.  Select the **Sign-in method** tab.
3.  Click **Add new provider**.
4.  Choose a provider from the list (e.g., Email/Password, Google, Apple, etc.).
5.  Follow the official Firebase instructions to configure the selected provider. This may require you to obtain API keys or other credentials from the provider's developer console.

<Callout>
  You must enable each provider you intend to use in your application. If a provider is not enabled here, attempts to sign in with it will fail.
